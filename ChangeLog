2000-06-08  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-region.el (mmm-overlays-in):
	Added checks for point-min and point-max for XEmacs.
	(use-local-map): Added the advice back in.
	
2000-06-08  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* configure.in, mmm-vars.el: Released 0.3.9.

	* mmm-region.el (use-local-map):
	Conditioned advice definition on not XEmacs.

2000-06-08  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-region.el (use-local-map):
	Conditioned advice definition on not XEmacs.

2000-05-28  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* .cvsignore:
	Added info file and auxiliary compilation and texinfo files.

	* .cvsignore: Added configure auxiliary files.

	* .cvsignore: Ignored Makefile.in, Makefile, and configure.

	* COPYING, INSTALL, install-sh, mdate-sh, missing, mkinstalldirs, texinfo.tex:
	Added files required by automake.

	* mmm.texinfo, elisp-comp, TODO, README, NEWS, ChangeLog, AUTHORS:
	Added to CVS (formerly not under RCS).

2000-05-24  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-auto.el: Pre-added major mode hook to text-mode-hook.

2000-05-19  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-vars.el (mmm-version): changed to 0.3.8.

2000-05-18  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-region.el:
	Moved `require's back to top level for byte-compiling.  Added dummy
	definition of `mmm-real-use-local-map' to shut up byte compiler.

	* mmm-mode.el, mmm-cmds.el, mmm-class.el:
	Moved `require's back to top level for byte-compiling.

	* mmm-auto.el: `require'd mmm-vars at top level for byte-compiling.

	* Makefile.am:
	Added all the elisp files to EXTRA_DIST, since Automake doesn't see
	them as sources for the distribution.

2000-05-10  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-mason.el: Fixed bug: # is not allowed in symbols.

	* mmm-mason.el:
	Changed insertion key of <%doc> to `d' and added insertion of %#
	comment lines with insertion keys `#' and `3'.

	* mmm-mason.el:
	Distinguished between Perl sections and pseudo-Perl sections.  The one
	inserts ; at the beginning for indentation hack, the other doesn't
	because the Mason syntax doesn't allow it and indentation is generally
	unnecessary anyway.

	* mmm-cmds.el:
	Fixed "sub"-insertion specs like <%perl> under <%TAG> not to insert
	the interactor string.

2000-05-03  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-mason.el: Added dependencies on mmm-compat and mmm-vars.

2000-04-30  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: New file.

	* mmm-sample.el, mmm-mode.el, mmm-region.el, mmm-auto.el, mmm-class.el, mmm-cmds.el, mmm-mason.el:
	Changed (progn (require ...)) to (when t (require ...)) because the
	first is still "top level" for the byte compiler.

	* mmm-region.el:
	Required font-lock and mmm-auto at top level for byte compilation.
	Moved local maps to come before updating hooks for byte compilation.

	* mmm-utils.el: Loaded CL at top level for byte-compile.

2000-04-29  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-mode.el, mmm-region.el, mmm-sample.el, mmm-auto.el, mmm-class.el, mmm-cmds.el, mmm-mason.el:
	Put all `require's not needed at compile-time into `progn's so the
	byte-compiler doesn't load them (not at top level).  Only `mmm-compat'
	and `mmm-utils' need to be loaded at compile-time, since they define
	macros.

2000-04-27  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* All: Started using RCS.

2000-04-27  Michael Abraham Shulman  <mas@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-sample.el (mmm-javascript-mode): Created customization
	variable to select mode to use for javascript regions.

2000-03-26  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-cmds.el (mmm-get-insertion-spec): Insertion keys now have
	symbolic names, although they have no definition.
	(mmm-insertion-help): Command added to give help on insertion
	keys, the way C-h does for command keys.

	* mmm-vars.el (mmm-get-all-classes): Reversed order, so
	interactive classes take precedence (for insertion, mainly) over
	`mmm-classes' which overrides mode/ext classes.

2000-03-24  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-vars.el (mmm-command-modifiers, mmm-insert-modifiers):
	Switched defaults to be the way I think it should be. Users can
	switch back with `mmm-use-old-command-keys'.

	* README: Created file giving information on inital installation.

	* Makefile: Created makefile to compile elisp files and make info
	file from texinfo file.

	* mmm-region.el: Gave up on conditional stickiness, since it
	doesn't work in XEmacs and even FSF Emacs has been being flaky
	with overlay after-change functions. Detecting ends in global
	`after-change-functions' will work better anyway.

	* mmm-cmds.el: Renamed from `mmm-inter.el'.
	(mmm-end-current-region): Added command, with key binding.

	* mmm-vars.el (mmm-classes-alist): Documentation updated for
	unified submode classes.

	* mmm-class.el (mmm-ify): BEG and END arguments removed; just use
	FRONT and BACK.

	* mmm-utils.el (mmm-format-matches): Ignores non-string arguments.

	* mmm-class.el (mmm-apply-class): Faces supplied for grouping
	classes now override those on included classes. Parents will do
	the same thing.

	* mmm-inter.el: Bound `mmm-parse-block' to C-c % 5 as well.
	(mmm-reparse-current-region): Added command, with key binding.

	* mmm-insert.el: Deleted file, merging contents (insert by
	keystrokes) into `mmm-inter.el'. Auto-detection insert will
	probably go elsewhere.

	* mmm-inter.el (mmm-clear-current-region): Uses `mmm-overlay-at'
	with `all' inclusion type.

	* mmm-region.el (mmm-overlays-at): Added `all' inclusion type.

	* mmm-class.el (mmm-apply-class, etc.): Submode classes have been
	unified--no more 'regexp, 'region, 'group, etc.

2000-03-23  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-inter.el (mmm-parse-buffer, mmm-parse-region, mmm-parse-block):
	Added "Operating...done" messages.

	* mmm-region.el (mmm-make-region): Allowed caller to add extra
	keyword arguments to be stored as overlay properties, anticipating
	new future submode classes.

	* mmm-update.el (use-local-map): Advised to keep track of changed
	local maps.

	* mmm-region.el (mmm-overlays-at): Added inclusion of boundary
	points based on endpoint stickiness.
	(mmm-match-front, mmm-match-back): Front and back overlay
	properties can now be functions rather than regexps, in
	anticipation of new future submode classes.

2000-03-22  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-utils.el (mmm-valid-buffer): Renamed and added checking for
	"never" modes.

	* mmm-vars.el (mmm-never-modes): Added, to prevent "temporary
	shell-mode buffers" and other unnecessariness.

	* mmm-region.el (mmm-overlays-in): Fixed strictness so it doesn't
	try to match delimiters of non-mmm overlays.

	* mmm-update.el (mmm-local-maps-alist): Keep track of changed
	local maps by buffer and major mode.
	(mmm-update-submode-region): Update mode info for major mode.

	* mmm-sample.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-auto.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mason.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-insert.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

2000-03-20  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* mmm-update.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-inter.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-class.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-mode.el (mason): Removed highlight for %doc regions.

	* mmm-region.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-utils.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-compat.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* mmm-vars.el: Created file, removing code from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* TODO: Created TODO file, removing comments from `mmm-mode.el'.

	* ChangeLog: Created ChangeLog file and (more or less) ported
	existing Change Log to official format.

2000-03-19  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
	        
	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-global-mode): usurps and extends the role of
	`mmm-add-find-file-hook'. Other modes can piggyback on our hack by
	using `mmm-major-mode-hook'.
        
	Added :insert class parameters. Classes can now define skeletons
	to insert submode regions with delimiters based on a keypress.

	Added `mmm-insert-modifiers' and `mmm-command-modifiers' to
	configure which keys do what.

2000-03-18  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
	
	* mmm-mode.el: Did a bunch of reorganizing. MMM-ification methods
	are now submode classes, and what used to be called submode
	classes are now just a type called :group. User interface is
	mostly unchanged however. Replaced some gratuitous keywords with
	normal symbols.

	Added bells and whistles to :regexp class type, allowing custom
	"plugin" functions to verify matches and get the delimiter forms,
	the latter of which aren't used yet, but will be soon. Mason
	class(es) are now all regexps with a plugin or two. Function class
	type is not (yet?) ported to the new interface, holding back
	eval-elisp and htp.p with it.
        
	Changed a couple of `eval-and-compile's to `eval-when-compile'.
        
	Added special "non-submode" regions, where the major mode holds
	sway, but no submodes allowed (until parents are implemented).
	Added %doc in text-mode and %text as a non-submode to Mason, and
	added %flags, %attr, %method, and %shared tags for Mason classes.
	These will be new in Mason version 0.82.
        
2000-03-14  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* Version 0.3.7a released.

	* mmm-mode.el: Put `turn-on-font-lock-if-enabled' back in for FSF
	  Emacs. Don't know why I thought I could take it out.
        
2000------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* Version 0.3.7 released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el: Set insertion types of markers added to history to
	coincide with sticky ends of overlays. It's not perfect, but it's
	better.

	Renamed mode and submode hook variables to start with `mmm-'.

	Added "class hooks" run whenever a class is first used in a
	buffer.

	Changes for XEmacs compatibility:
          - Loaded XEmacs overlay emulation package.
          - Renamed some overlay properties when in XEmacs
          - Removed `global-font-lock-mode' dependencies.
          - Added extra parameter to `regexp-opt' in Mason class.
        
	Removed "Disclaimers" comment section; I think we have enough
	testing that it should work on most systems.
        
	Reversed order of Change Log so newer changes come first.
        
	Changed the default submode highlight to a more neutral gray.
        
	Renamed various "start" and "end" parameters to be more uniform.
        
	(mmm-ify-by-region): now checks if the region is in bounds.
        
1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.6c released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el: Added comment about putting autohandlers and
	dhandlers in html-mode.

1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.6b released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el: Added comment about `psgml-mode' thanks to Michael
	Alan Dorman.

1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.6a released.

	* mmm-mode.el: Loaded CL at compile-time to prevent execution of
	macro arguments.

1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.6 released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el: Changes for Emacs 19 compatibility.
	  - Set keyword variables to themselves.
	  - Added hacks for absence of custom.el and regexp-opt.
	  - Added user variable to control use of Perl mode vs CPerl mode.
	Thanks to Eric A. Zarko for suggestions and testing.

1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.5a released.

	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-ify-by-all): no longer re-fontifies buffers
	with no submodes.

1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.5 released.

	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-fontify-region): now locally binds
	`font-lock-beginning-of-syntax-function' to
	`mmm-beginning-of-syntax' since `font-lock-fontify-block' binds it
	to nil for some reason.

1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.4 released.

	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-ify-by-class): now fontifies the buffer
	afterward, like the other interactive MMM-ification functions.
	Updated a couple doc-strings and prompts.
        
1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.3 released.

	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-regexp-to-regions, mmm-mason-inline): Changed
	recursion to iteration, since for long files the recursion runs
	afoul of `max-lisp-eval-depth'.
	(mason): Commented on workaround for Mason CPerl mess-ups.
	Submode overlays now evaporate if they have zero width.
	(mmm-parse-region): now has a key binding and doesn't refontify
	the entire buffer.
	
1999------  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.2 released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-mode-on, mmm-mode-off): are now interactive.
	Fixed bug in Mason class: %def, %text, and %doc are now ignored as
	they should be.

1999-11-21  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.1 released.

	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-ify-by-class) now adds to history rather than
	`mmm-classes'.
	Fixed :class keyword so it works correctly.
	(mmm-add-mode-ext-class): Classes associated with major modes or
	filenames now do The Right Thing when the major mode is changed.
	However, `mmm-mode-ext-classes-alist' cannot be directly modified.
	(mmm-mode): Updated documentation to cover 0.3.x changes.
        
1999-11-21  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.3.0 released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-ify-by-class): Added interactive prompt.
	(mmm-version): Function added to display version interactively.
	Fixed and updated customization definitions.
	(mmm-mode-ext-classes-alist): added, allowing the automatic
	association of certain major-modes and/or file extensions with
	submode classes.
	Allowed submode lists to contain :class keyword, so one class can
	invoke another one, if they share submode methods.

1999-11-19  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>

	* Version 0.2.2a released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el: Fixed bug.

1999-11-18  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.2.2 released.

	* mmm-mode.el (mmm-mason-inline): Replaces the regexps "<% " and
	"%>" for HTML::Mason submode class. Inline perl regions don't have
	to begin with a space, but the regexp "<%" matches "<%perl>" as
	well, which it shouldn't.
	Added `save-match-data' calls in all searching functions.
	Removed unnecessary auxiliary functions.

1999-11-16  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
        
	* Version 0.2.1 released.
        
	* mmm-mode.el: Fixed font-lock absence, with-temp-message absence,
	mmm-ifying temp buffer.

1999-11-15  Michael Abraham Shulman  <viritrilbia@kurukshetra.cjb.net>
	
	* Version 0.2.0 released to HTML::Mason mailing list.

	* Comment: Although nearly 100% of the code for mmm-mode was
	written by me, the original inspiration came from mmm.el for
	XEmacs by Gongquan Chen <chen@posc.org>, so I have continued his
	version-numbering.
        
1999-01-12  Gongquan Chen <chen@posc.org>
        
	* Version 0.11 released.

	* mmm.el: Fixed doc-strings and style. Thanks to comments from
	Jari Aalto <jaalto@tre.tele.nokia.fi>

1999-01-11  Gongquan Chen <chen@posc.org>
	
	* Version 0.10 released.

	* mmm.el: Initial release of mmm.el on comp.emacs.xemacs
